This is the repository for the measured data. The file names indicate the following 

1. The number of the multiplier, eg 1_, 2_, etc
2. How dense was the measurement. The defult is 94x94, implying the 94 values were taken in the interval 0-1023 (with end value 1023)
3. The ending declares whether is the standard deviation of the measrements or the mesh grid that was used (for reference).


A few of the measurements where taken with slightly denser grid, e.g. 128x128. 


In the OLD File, the old measurements are included, perhaps for measurements, reference or cross validation of the results. 

Note that the components 40-50 have been measured with the matching circuit on the switches. (this affect the STD of the measurements and possibly slightly the phase of the measured signal)
