Here the data for the 4 ort feedback couplers. The data is

component[0,0] - is the J1 to J2 port (alpha2) 
component[0,1] - is the J1 to J4 port (beta1) 
component[1,0] - is the J3 to J2 port (beta2) 
component[1,1] - is the J3 to J4 port (alpha1)

The two alpha are the transmission component while the beta are the coupling coefficients. 
alpha2 is almost 0.95
